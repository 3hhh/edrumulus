- Record test signal for CY-5

- Record test signal for PDX-8

- Record test signal for HD-1 tom pad

- Hot spot suppression on mesh pads with center piezo
  -> striking directly on the piezo results in detected velocity values which are much too high

- Create PCB for Prototype2 based on ESP32

- Signal overload correction
  -> maybe based on low-pass filtering as suggested in https://github.com/corrados/edrumulus/discussions/17#discussion-3736264

- Create pad parameter set for CY-5

- Create pad parameter set for PDX-8

- Create pad parameter set for HD-1 tom pad

- Documentation: Algorithm description

- Documentation: Edrumulus manual which describes the hardware/software setup, parameter description, HOWTOs, etc.

- Attach second piezo on mesh pad and experiment with improved velocity/position detection using the second piezo signal

- Create Qt application for controlling Edrumulus via MIDI using the rtmidi library

- support hardware keyboard/display like Arduino LCD1602 Display Keypad Shield
